### Lore:

**Just a Real Nice Pond**

It's got a view of the mountain and everything… wow. There couldn't possibly be anything nefarious about it! The locals assure travelers that the pond is just fine. Absolutely nothing suspicious at all. Sure, sometimes the ripples spell out words like “RUN”… and sometimes the ducks quack in morse code… but other than that, it's definitely cozy and safe.

Fireflies flit about the pond, illuminating the area with their gentle glow. It is said that catching 10 teleports you to a secret, mystical location. Try your luck at catching them!
